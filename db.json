      "content": "Economics is important for many areas of society. It can help improve living standards and make society a better place. Economics is like science in that it can be used to improve living standards and also to make things worse. It partly depends on the priorities of society and what we consider most important.\n\nConsumption and Management discovers and elaborates three rules: natural economic law, market regulation law, and the law of macro-economic control. Natural economic law refers to the natural rule (mother rule) that three important consumptions drive the cyclic development of the economy.",
